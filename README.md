# lmt70-mini-pcb
A miniature pcb for the lmt70 to be mounted on a cable for submersed measurements.

# Testing version 1 of PCB
It works! Nothing majorly wrong with this pcb except that it is very small. It was easy to cut away the excess parts so this is a decent method for my uses. What really didn't work well was the hole size for the connecting parts. The holes need to be about twice the size to work well for wire sizes that are easy to handle.
